I work within the fields of machine learning, causality, and fair/ethical AI. I'm mainly interested in causality-based notions of fairness, counterfactual reasoning, and situated knowledge. As a consequence, I'm also intrrested in Bayesian inference, graphical probability modeling, and the philosophy of causality.
