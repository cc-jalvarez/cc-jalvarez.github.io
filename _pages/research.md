My research lies within the fields of machine learning, causality, and ethical AI. I'm mainly interested in causal notions of fairness, structural counterfactuals, and knowledge representation.

### Work in Progress

Weighted Partial Dependence Plots.

Get me a comparator: causal and legal reasoning for proving algorithmic discrimination.
