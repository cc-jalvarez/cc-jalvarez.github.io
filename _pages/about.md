I am PhD Candidate in Data Science at the Scuola Normale Superiore, a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher (ESR) with the [NoBIAS](https://nobias-project.eu/) project, and a member of the University of Pisa's Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Laboratory ([KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/)). My research focuses on developing causal methods for tackling bias in machine learning systems. My supervisor is Professor [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/).

Prior to moving to Pisa and starting my PhD, I worked at Deloitte Belgium as a data science consultant for over three years. My projects ranged across the banking and energy & utilities sectors, where I specialized in building financial and operational risk models. I also worked as a Summer Economist at the UK Cabinet Office in 2016.

I hold MSc in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the Toulouse School of Economics (2017), and a BA in Economics and History from the University of Florida (2015), where I attended as a Davis UWC Scholar. I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela.
