I am a PhD Candidate in Data Science at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. Salvatore Ruggieri. As an Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with the NoBIAS: AI without Bias ITN project at the University of Pisa, I'm also the recipient of a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship from the European Commission. 

My research focuses on causality-based methods for algorithmic fairness and machine learning.
