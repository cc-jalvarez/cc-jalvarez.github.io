Greetings! I am PhD Candidate in Data Science at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy, studying fair machine learning. I am also a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher with the [NoBIAS: Artificial Intelligence without Bias](https://nobias-project.eu/) project, and a member of the ([Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Laboratory](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/)) of the University of Pisa. My supervisor is Professor [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/).

My research focuses on how to use causality to detect bias in data used for or derived from AI-driven decision-making processes. I am currently interested in fair ranking algorithms employed for candidate screenings. Overall, my research is interdisciplinary and draws mainly from computer science, economics, and data science. Topic-wise, I am interested in algorithm design, causal fairness, mechanism design, and data as an engineering problem.

Before starting my PhD, I was a senior data scientist at Deloitte Belgium for over three years, where I specialized in building financial and operational risk models. Prior to Deloitte, I was a Summer Economist for the UK Government's Cabinet Office.

I hold MSc in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the Toulouse School of Economics, France, and a BA in Economics and History from the University of Florida, USA, where I attended as a Davis UWC Scholar. I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela.

Feel free to reach out, and thank you for stopping by.
