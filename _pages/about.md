I am a PhD Candidate in Data Science at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. Salvatore Ruggieri. As an Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with the NoBIAS ITN project at the University of Pisa, I'm also the recipient of a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship from the European Commission. 

My research focuses on causality-based methods for fairness and machine learning.
