Welcome to my website. I'm a Data Science PhD Student at the Scuola Normale Superiore and a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher with NoBIAS ITN at the University of Pisa. 

My research focuses on fair machine learning, where I study causality-based fairness for bias mitigation in data and algorithmic decision-makers. My advisor is Salvatore Ruggieri from the University of Pisa.

**Updates**

*Oct. 2021:* I defended successfully my first-year of PhD to my Individual Panel. The panel included: Salvatore Ruggieri (Univerity of Pisa), Bettina Berendt (KU Leuven), Giovanni Commande (Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies), Carlos Castillo (Pompeu Fabra), and Stan Matwin (Dalhousie University). The main topic was on meaningful counterfactuals.

*Sep. 2021:* I started my three-month research visit to Generali Italia, where I'm looking at fair ranking algorithms for candidate hiring.
