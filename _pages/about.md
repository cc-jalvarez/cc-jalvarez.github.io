I am a PhD Candidate in [Data Science](https://www.phd-ai.it/) at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy, under the supervision of [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/). As an Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with the [NoBIAS: AI wihtout Bias ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/) at the University of Pisa's KDD Lab, I'm also the recipient of a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) from the European Commission.

My main research area is algorithmic fairness, with a focus on causal reasoning and data science applications for automated decision-making systems.
