I am a data science researcher interested in tools for algorithmic decision-making and their societal implications. Broadly, my work focuses on the intersection of fairness, causal reasoning, and machine learning. See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&view_op=list_works&gmla=AC6lMd8Ud2MbFYnNEDotPb1NjTu3AOp8-9uVIrS4I0gFhOAszCLioVnuMZG8pS7SjvWeBoj1wTzQXoTL8_2vRSuQ&user=SD_BQEoAAAAJ), [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/59/6703-2.html), and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?query=0000-0001-9412-9013&searchtype=orcid&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=100) for details.

I will start as a postdoc in machine learning at KU Leuven this November.

I am currently a postoc in machine learning at KU Leuven this November, working with [Jesse Davies](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/), [Wouter Verbeke](https://ai.kuleuven.be/members/00054694), and [Jente Van Belle](https://ai.kuleuven.be/members/00146184).

I completed my Ph.D. in Data Science from the Scuola Normale Superiore, advised by [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/). As an Early-Stage Researcher with [NoBIAS ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/), I was a recipient of a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) and a member of the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/). Previously, I studied Econometrics and Empirical Economics (M.Sc.) at the Toulouse School of Economics, and Economics and History (B.A.), double major, at the University of Florida where I attended as a [UWC Scholar](https://www.davisuwcscholars.org/). I also worked at Deloitte as a Senior Risk Modeler. See my [CV](/files/AlvarezJoseCV.pdf) for details.
