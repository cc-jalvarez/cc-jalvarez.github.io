I'm a [Data Science PhD]( https://www.phd-ai.it/) Student at Scuola Normale Superiore, and a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with [NoBIAS: Artificial Intelligence without Bias](https://nobias-project.eu/) at the University of Pisa. I study algorithmic fairness, focusing on causality-based approaches for bias detection in data and machine learning models. My supervisor is Professor [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/).

My current research is on fair ranking algorithms for hiring purposes. I’m interested in situations where two candidates differ on the protected attribute but have similar observable characteristics can no longer be viewed as tied once some domain-specific knowledge becomes available to the decision maker. For instance, consider two candidates – male and female – with similar CVs. Would the decision-maker still view them as tied if she incorporated, say, the knowledge that on average men overestimate their skills while women underestimate theirs during job applications? The general idea would be to operationalize this in an algorithmic setting.

Before starting my PhD, I was a senior risk modeler / data scientist at Deloitte Belgium for over three years, where I specialized in building financial and operational risk models. Prior to Deloitte, I was a Summer Economist for the UK Government Cabinet Office.

I hold MSc in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the Toulouse School of Economics, France, and a BA in Economics and History from the University of Florida, USA, where I attended as a Davis UWC Scholar. I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela. I also studied the International Baccalaureate at Pearson College UWC, Canada, where I attended under a full scholarship.

Feel free to reach out for potential collaborations, and thanks for stopping by.
