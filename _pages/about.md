**Updates:**

I recently defended my first-year of PhD.

**About:**

I'm a [Data Science PhD]( https://www.phd-ai.it/) Student at Scuola Normale Superiore, and a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with [NoBIAS](https://nobias-project.eu/) at the University of Pisa's [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/). I study algorithmic fairness, focusing on causality-based approaches for bias detection in data and machine learning models. My supervisor is Prof. [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/).

Before starting my PhD, I was a senior risk modeler / data scientist at Deloitte Belgium for over three years, where I specialized in building financial and operational risk models. Prior to Deloitte, I was a Summer Economist for the UK Government Cabinet Office.

I hold MSc in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the Toulouse School of Economics, France, and a BA in Economics and History from the University of Florida, USA, where I attended as a Davis UWC Scholar. I also studied the International Baccalaureate at Pearson College UWC, Canada. I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela.

Feel free to reach out for potential collaborations, and thanks for stopping by.
