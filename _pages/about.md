I am a PhD Candidate in [Data Science](https://www.phd-ai.it/) at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy, under the supervision of [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/). As an Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with the [NoBIAS: AI wihtout Bias ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/) at the University of Pisa's [KKD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/alvarez-jose-manuel), I'm also the recipient of a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) from the European Commission.

My main research area is on algorithmic fairness, where I use causal machine learning to formalize, detect, and prevent potential discrimination in automated decision-making systems. I focus mostly on the EU context.

I am on the 2023-2024 job market, looking for post-doc opportunities.

**Activities**

I co-organized the 2nd European Workshop on Algorithmic Fairness, or [EWAF'23](https://sites.google.com/view/ewaf23/home), and I am a co-founder and current member of the European Association for Algorithmic Fairness, which ensures the growth of EWAF and its eventual transition into a conference.

I am a member of the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/); [EU Horizon 2020 NoBIAS ITN Project](https://nobias-project.eu/); and [MD4SG](https://www.md4sg.com/).
