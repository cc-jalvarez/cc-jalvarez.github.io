I am PhD Candidate in Data Science at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy, where I focus on algorithmic fairness. I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with the [NoBIAS: Artificial Intelligence without Bias](https://nobias-project.eu/) project, and a member of the University of Pisa's Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Laboratory ([KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/)). My supervisor is Professor [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/).

My research interest is interdisciplinary and lies, broadly speaking, at the intersection between computer science, economics, and data science. From computer science I draw from the fields of algorithm design and causality (from the perspective of causal Bayesian networks), while from economics I draw from the fields of matching markets, mechanism design and information economics. Finally, I use the deployment-driven / real-world-application focus that characterizes data science as a field and industry to focus on problems and solutions that are or can be used in today’s digital world.

Before starting my PhD, I was as a senior data scientist at Deloitte Belgium where I worked for over three years. My projects ranged across the banking and energy & utilities sectors, where I specialized in building financial and operational risk models. I also represented Belgium at the [Deloitte aiStudio](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/risk/solutions/aistudio.html) in Frankfurt, Germany, which is Deloitte Europe's AI lab accelerator. Prior to Deloitte, I worked as a Summer Economist for the UK Government (Cabinet Office) in 2016.

I hold MSc in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the Toulouse School of Economics, France, and a BA in Economics and History from the University of Florida, USA, where I attended as a Davis UWC Scholar. I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela.
