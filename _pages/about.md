I obtained my Ph.D. in [Data Science](https://datasciencephd.eu/) from the Scuola Normale Superiore, advised by [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/) at the University of Pisa. As an Early-Stage Researcher with the [NoBIAS ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/), I was also a recipient of a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) and a member of the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/). During my PhD, I visited SCHUFA, KU Leuven, and Generali.  

Previously, I studied Economics and History (B.A.) at the University of Florida and Econometrics (M.Sc.) at the Toulouse School of Economics. I also worked for Deloitte as a Risk Modeler.
