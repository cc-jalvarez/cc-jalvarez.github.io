I'm a Data Science PhD Student at the University of Pisa and a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with NoBIAS ITN. My research focuses on causality for fairness in machine learning. My advisor is Salvatore Ruggieri.

**Updates**

*Oct. 2021:* I defended successfully my first-year of PhD to my Individual Panel. The panel included: Salvatore Ruggieri (Univerity of Pisa), Bettina Berendt (KU Leuven), Giovanni Commande (Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies), Carlos Castillo (Pompeu Fabra), and Stan Matwin (Dalhousie University). The main topic was on meaningful counterfactuals.

*Sep. 2021:* I started my three-month research visit to Generali Italia, where I'm looking at fair ranking algorithms for candidate hiring.
