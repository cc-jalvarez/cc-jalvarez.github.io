I will be starting as a postoc in machine learning at KU Leuven this November, working with [Jesse Davies](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/), [Wouter Verbeke](https://ai.kuleuven.be/members/00054694), and [Jente Van Belle](https://ai.kuleuven.be/members/00146184).

I completed my Ph.D. in Data Science from the [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/it) in July 2024, advised by [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/). As an Early-Stage Researcher with [NoBIAS: AI without Bias ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/), I was a recipient of a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/). I was also a member of the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/).

Previously, I studied Econometrics (M.Sc.) at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/) and Economics and History (B.A.) at the [University of Florida](https://clas.ufl.edu/) where I attended as a [UWC Scholar](https://www.davisuwcscholars.org/). I also worked for over three years at [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/be/en.html) as a Senior Risk Modeler. Here is my [CV](/files/AlvarezJoseCV.pdf).
