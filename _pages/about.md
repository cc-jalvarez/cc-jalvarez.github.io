I'm a PhD Candidate in Data Science at Scuola Normale Superiore. As an Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with NoBIAS ITN, I'm also the recipient of a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship from the European Commission. My research focuses on causality-based methods for fairness and machine learning. My advisor is Prof. Salvatore Ruggieri.
