Greetings! My name is Jose M. Alvarez. I'm Data Science PhD Student and a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher with NoBIAS at the University of Pisa. Welcome to my website. 

**Updates:**

Oct.: I recently defended successfully my first-year of PhD to my Individual Panel. The panel included: Salvatore Ruggieri (Univerity of Pisa), Bettina Berendt (KU Leuven), Giovanni Commande (Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies), Carlos Castillo (Pompeu Fabra), and Stan Matwin (Dalhousie University). The main topic was on meaningful counterfactuals.

Sep.: I started my three-month research visit to Generali Italia, where I'm looking at fair ranking algorithms for candidate hiring.
