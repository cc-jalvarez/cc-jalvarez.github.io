I am a data science researcher interested in tools for algorithmic decision-making and their societal implications.
Broadly, my work focuses on the intersection of fairness, causal reasoning, and machine learning.
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at KU Leuven's [DTAI](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/dtai) and [LIRIS](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/decision-sciences-and-information-management/liris/liris) working with [Jesse Davies](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/) and [Wouter Verbeke](https://ai.kuleuven.be/members/00054694).

I completed my PhD in Data Science from the Scuola Normale Superiore, where I was advised by [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/). As an Early-Stage Researcher with [NoBIAS ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/), I was a recipient of a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) and a member of the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/). 
Previously, I studied Econometrics and Empirical Economics (MSc) at the Toulouse School of Economics; and Economics and History (BA), double major, at the University of Florida. 
I also worked at Deloitte Belgium as a Senior Risk Modeler.
