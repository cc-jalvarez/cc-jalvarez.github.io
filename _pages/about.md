I will be starting as a postoc in machine learning at KU Leuven this November, working with [Jesse Davies](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/), [Wouter Verbeke](https://ai.kuleuven.be/members/00054694), and [Jente Van Belle](https://ai.kuleuven.be/members/00146184).

I completed my Ph.D. in Data Science from the Scuola Normale Superiore in July 2024 advised by [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/). As an Early-Stage Researcher with [NoBIAS: AI without Bias ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/), I was a recipient of a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/). I was also a member of the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/). Previously, I studied Econometrics (M.Sc.) at the Toulouse School of Economics and Economics and History (B.A.) at the University of Florida where I attended as a [UWC Scholar](https://www.davisuwcscholars.org/). I also worked at Deloitte as a Senior Risk Modeler. See my [CV](/files/AlvarezJoseCV.pdf) for more details.

Broadly, I am interested in data science tools for algorithmic decision-making and its societal implications. My work focuses on the intersection of causal inference, machine learning, and algorithmic fairness. See [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F4flRnyZl09a2Q8S4L8ySoeG4CMpCfYBDwXEUNYEHYVENmZOn2P_-xzO8QxNhaCetZlL4nNTOvPu5NCqS0LpIMuUuUtPPpDL2_yeO8J-z23TTxdWns&user=otFhtYMAAAAJ), [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/59/6703-2.html), and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?query=0000-0001-9412-9013&searchtype=orcid&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=100) for details.
