Welcome to my website. I'm a PhD Student in Data Science and a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher with the NoBIAS ITN at the University of Pisa. 

My research focuses on algorithmic fairness, where I study causality-based fairness for bias mitigation. My advisor is Salvatore Ruggieri.

**Updates**

*Oct. 2021:* I defended successfully my first-year of PhD to my Individual Panel. The panel included: Salvatore Ruggieri (Univerity of Pisa), Bettina Berendt (KU Leuven), Giovanni Commande (Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies), Carlos Castillo (Pompeu Fabra), and Stan Matwin (Dalhousie University). The main topic was on meaningful counterfactuals.

*Sep. 2021:* I started my three-month research visit to Generali Italia, where I'm looking at fair ranking algorithms for candidate hiring.
