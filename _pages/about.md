I am a PhD Candidate in [Data Science](https://www.phd-ai.it/) at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/). As an Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with the [NoBIAS: AI wihtout Bias ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/) at the University of Pisa, I'm also the recipient of a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship from the European Commission. 

My main research is on algorithmic fairness, where I use causal machine learning to formalize, detect, and prevent potential discrimination in automated decision-making systems.

This academic year, I will be looking for post-doc opportunities.
