I guess this is the non-professional part of my webpage. I’m a big bookworm and I often feel the need to share the books that leave an impression on me. Here, I’ll try to do exactly that. Although this section is somewhat (publicly) personal, in that I’m writing this without expecting anybody else to read it, secretly, I do hope someone stumbles upon it and finds it welcoming. Already just one interested reader would be too many.

I’m also a big music fan, though I have a harder time putting those feelings into words. I used to be decent at drums, but at this point I have a higher chance of winning a Nobel than to play like [Vinnie Colaiuta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwmCeon6aPo&ab_channel=KevO%27Shea).
