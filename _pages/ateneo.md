**Books**

I'm currently reading Diarmaid MacCulloch's *Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years*.

**Music**

Iâ€™m a big music fan. I used to be decent at drums, but at this point I have a higher chance of winning a Nobel Prize than to play like [Vinnie Colaiuta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwmCeon6aPo&ab_channel=KevO%27Shea).

**Other**

During my time at TSE, I was the Deputy Editor as well as a writer of the student-run magazine [*The TSEconomist*](https://thetseconomist.com/). Below I highlight some of my pieces:

* "Gauche Caviar" (Num.16, 2017) [Link to PDF](https://thetseconomist.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/issue16-compressed.pdf).
* With Marina Sanchez Del Villar, "In his own narrative: An interview with Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller" (Num.14, 2016) [Link to PDF](https://thetseconomist.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/issue_14-thomas.pdf).
