This is, I guess, the non-professional part of my webpage. I’m a big bookworm and I often feel the need to share my thoughts on the books that leave an impression on me. Here, I’ll try to do exactly that. Although this section is somewhat (publicly) personal, in that I’m writing this without expecting anybody else to read it, secretly, I do hope somebody else stumbles upon it and finds it welcoming. Already just one interested reader would be too many.

I’m also a huge music fan, though I have a harder time putting those feelings into words. At some point I was decent at drums, but I think at this point I have a higher chance of winning a Nobel than ever playing like [Vinnie Colaiuta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwmCeon6aPo&ab_channel=KevO%27Shea).
