My Ph.D. focused on causal algorithmic fairness. Being an ESR with the [NoBIAS ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/), I was a member of the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/) of the University of Pisa and visited Generali Italia, KU Leuven's DTAI group, and SCHUFA Holdings.

I received a B.A. (double major) in Economics and History from the [University of Florida](https://clas.ufl.edu/) in Gainesville, USA, and a M.Sc. in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/) in Toulouse, France. 

Before Pisa, I worked for three years as a Risk Modeler at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/be/en.html) in Brussels, Belgium, reaching the level of Senior Consultant. I specialized in building and deploying financial and operational risk models using statistical machine learning for banks and energy companies, respectively. I was also chosen to participate at the [Deloitte aiStudio](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/risk/solutions/aistudio.html) in Frankfurt, Germany, where I developed [Clairvoyance](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/risk/solutions/ai-based-forecasting-solution-clairvoyance.html), a time series forecasting tool. I also interned as an Economist at the UK Cabinet Office in the summer of 2016. 

Born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela, after finishing high-school back home I won a full scholarship to study the International Baccalaureate at [Lester B. Pearson United World College](https://www.pearsoncollege.ca/), BC, Canada. UWC allowed me to attend the University of Florida under a fulll scholarship as a [Davis United World College Scholar](https://www.davisuwcscholars.org/).

When I am not learning from machines, I play football (Amatori AICS B1), read books, and practice drums. 

I currently live in Florence, Italy.
