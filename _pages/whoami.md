I received a BA (double major) in Economics and History from the [University of Florida](https://clas.ufl.edu/), USA, and a MSc in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/), France. 

Before Pisa, I worked for three years as a Risk Modeler at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/be/en.html) in Brussels, Belgium, reaching the level of Senior Consultant. I specialized in building and deploying financial and operational risk models using statistical machine learning for banks and energy companies, respectively. I was also chosen to participate at the [Deloitte aiStudio](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/risk/solutions/aistudio.html) in Frankfurt, Germany, where I developed [Clairvoyance](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/risk/solutions/ai-based-forecasting-solution-clairvoyance.html), a time series forecasting tool. I also interned as an Economist at the UK Cabinet Office in the summer of 2016. 

During my PhD, I've visited KU Leuven's DTAI group, Generali Italia, and Schufa Holding AG under the NoBIAS ITN.

Born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela, after finishing high-school back home I won a full scholarship to study the International Baccalaureate at [Lester B. Pearson United World College](https://www.pearsoncollege.ca/), BC, Canada. UWC allowed me to attend the University of Florida under a fulll scholarship as a [Davis United World College Scholar](https://www.davisuwcscholars.org/).

When I am not learning from machines, I play football (Amatori AICS B1), read books, and practice drums. 

I currently live in Florence, Italy.
