I'm a Ph.D. Student in [Data Science](https://www.phd-ai.it/) at the Scuola Normale Superiore. I'm also a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with the [NoBIAS: AI Without Bias](https://nobias-project.eu/) European Innovative Training Networkat (ITN) at the University of Pisa and a member of the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/). I study algorithmic fairness, focusing on causality-based approaches for bias detection in data and machine learning models. My advisor is Prof. [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/).

Before starting my Ph.D., I was a senior data scientist/risk modeler at Deloitte Belgium for over three years. At Deloitte, I specialized in building financial and operational risk models for banks and energy companies, respectively. I was also the Belgium representative to the [aiStudio](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/risk/solutions/aistudio.html) in Frankfurt, Germany, during a six-month secondment where I developed the time series forecasting tool Clairvoyance. Prior to Deloitte, I was a Summer Economist for the UK Government Cabinet Office.

I hold M.Sc. in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the Toulouse School of Economics, France, and a B.A. in Economics and History from the University of Florida, USA, where I attended under a fulll-scholarship as a Davis United World College Scholar. I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela. I currently live in Florence, Italy.

During my free time I like playing football, reading, and trying to improve my italian.
