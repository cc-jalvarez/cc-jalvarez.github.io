Before Pisa, I received a BA (double major) in Economics and History from the [University of Florida](https://clas.ufl.edu/), USA, and a MSc in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/), France. 

Between Pisa and Toulouse, I spent almost four years as a Risk Modeler at [Deloitte Belgium](https://www2.deloitte.com/be/en.html), reaching the level of Senior Consultant. There I specialized in building and deploying financial and operational risk models using statistical machine learning for banks and energy companies, respectively. I was also chosen to participate at the [Deloitte aiStudio](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/risk/solutions/aistudio.html) in Frankfurt, Germany, where I developed [Clairvoyance](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/risk/solutions/ai-based-forecasting-solution-clairvoyance.html), a time series forecasting tool. 

I have also been a Summer Economist for the UK Government Cabinet Office, and recently a Visiting Researcher at KU Leuven, Generali Italia, and Schufa Holding AG.

Born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela, after finishing high-school I won a full scholarship to study the IB at the [Lester B. Pearson United World College](https://www.pearsoncollege.ca/) in Canada. This allowed me to attend the University of Florida under a fulll scholarship as a [Davis United World College Scholar](https://www.davisuwcscholars.org/). I currently live in Florence, Italy.

When I am not learning from machines, I play football for the EUI (Amatori AICS B1), read books, and play drums.
