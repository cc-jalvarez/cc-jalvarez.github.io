I'm a PhD Student in [Data Science](https://www.phd-ai.it/) (jointly with Scuola Normale Superiore), a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) with the [NoBIAS: AI Without Bias](https://nobias-project.eu/) European Innovative Training Network (ITN), and a member of the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/) at the University of Pisa. I study algorithmic fairness, focusing on causality-based approaches for bias detection in data representations. My advisor is [Salvatore Ruggieri](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/).

Before starting my PhD, I was a senior risk modeler at Deloitte Belgium for over three years. I specialized in building financial and operational risk models for banks and energy companies, respectively. I was also the Belgium representative to the [aiStudio](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/risk/solutions/aistudio.html) in Frankfurt, Germany, during a six-month secondment where I developed *Clairvoyance*, an end-to-end time series forecasting tool. Prior to Deloitte, I was an Economist for the UK Government Cabinet Office.

I hold MSc in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the Toulouse School of Economics, France, and a BA in Economics and History from the University of Florida, USA, where I attended under a fulll-scholarship as a Davis United World College Scholar. I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela. I currently live in Florence, Italy.

When I'm not learning from machines, I like to play football, read books, and listen to music.
