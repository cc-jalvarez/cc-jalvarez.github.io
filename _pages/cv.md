Misc.
======
I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela, where I lived until I was 18. My plan after high school was to study Electronic Engineering back home, but I was not 100% sure and then I got a scholarship to study the International Baccalaureate (IB) at a secluded boarding school in the middle of Vancouver Island (Lester B. Pearson UWC) along with 200 other students from around the world. UWC changed my life. Over the past decade I have had the opportunity to study and work across multiple countries, including Canada, the USA, Colombia, France, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and currently Italy. I enjoy getting to know new cultures. It makes it all a little more interesting.
